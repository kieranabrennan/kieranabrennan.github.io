    I'm Co-founder of <a href="https://heartspacehealth.co.nz/">Heartspace</a>, where we're building tools for better breathing. The techique of resonant breathing helps to reduce stress and improve performance under pressure (see our blogs on the subject <a href="https://heartspacehealth.co.nz/blogs/new-featured-articles/the-ascent-of-heart-rate-variability-biofeedback-training">here</a>). The breathing practise has been studied since the 80s, and has recently come into prominence both in academia, and in popular revivals of traditional eastern practises. 
    <br><br>
    Our product teaches deep breathing using a process Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback using a wearable heart rate monitor and data analytics built into our app. We are currently launching in New Zealand and Australia.

    I was Director of Data at <a href="https://www.halterhq.com/">Halter</a> where I led the data science team, modelling pasture growth and building models for animal position tracking.
    This included the data collection process, designing the appropriate model architectures, and reading a lot of papers about cows and grass.

    In the senior leadership team we made decisions to launch into new markets, initiate new R&D, and cut losses on stagnant projects. We faced demanding growth expectations and tight market conditions while developing a challenging product that was mission-critial for our customers. We set up relationships to run studies on virtual fencing with world leaders in the field.

    Early on I developed the strategy for critical systems projects including how to calibrate a core sensor efficiently across on thousands of devices and conserve energy across the fleet, enabling Halter to deploy into new markets. 
    <br><br>
    I joined Halter after the Series A round of funding, and co-ordinated the first farm deployment. Halter has since deployed on hundreds of farms, in NZ and internationally and raised Series B & C funding rounds (USD $74M total).

    My PhD in biomedical engineering explored how <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/abi/our-research/research-groups-themes/bioinstrumentation-laboratory/needle-free-jet-injection.html">needle free drug delivery</a> could be controlled more accurately using laser imaging. I showed the depth of the injection could be calculated by measuring the scattered light pattern produced from light in the water jet. I built a laser-jet injection device, simulated the optics of skin tissue, and solved the inverse problem to calculate injection depth from scattered laser-light patterns.

    My PhD brought my background in mathematical modelling together with my passion for applied engineering in the biomedical domain. I developed a greater appreciation for hardware and electronics and honed my skills in experimentation and iterative development.

    As a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.soulmachines.com/">Soul Machines</a> under <a href="https://nzawards.org.nz/winners/mark-sagar-phd-frsnz/">Dr. Mark Sagar</a>, I developed a neural network for motor control of a virtual human avatar. The avatar could be trained to draw and play pong, built on a simple network called a self-organising map.

    I learnt to build models in a streaming, 3D graphics environment, and continued to work for Soul Machines during my PhD. When I began at Soul Machines in 2014 we were a team of six. By the time I left the company was over 70 employees and had raised USD $7.5m. As of 2024, Soul Machines has raised USD$135m in funding.

    BE at The University of Auckland, top of class in Engineering Science. This is where I developed a passion for applied mathematical modelling. My honours project was in the research lab which would later become Soul Machines. Optimisation problems were a theme throughout the degree, a notable project involving the simulation of power generation of a wind turbine, which we validated by building and testing it at the university's wind tunnel.

    Community involvement has played an important role in shaping how I like to lead teams. Through my undergraduate degree I tutored Physics and Biology in low socio-economic high schools, and was a supervisor in a hostel for first-year and international students.

<div class="project-title">Every Breath You Take (<a href="https://github.com/kieranabrennan/every-breath-you-take">github</a>)</div>
<div class="pdesc">It's possible to control your stress response through controlled breathing, with a technique called Biofeedback Training. I built <a href="https://github.com/kieranabrennan/every-breath-you-take">Every-Breath-You-Take</a> to measure and train this with a Polar H10 heart rate monitor. The project received some attention after being on the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37538028">Hacker News</a> for a week and formed the basis for building <a href="https://heartspacehealth.co.nz/">Heartspace</a>.</div>

<div class="pdesc">Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a heart beat arrhythmia that affects 30 million people worldwide. I built <a href="https://github.com/kieranabrennan/to-beat-or-not-to-beat">To Beat or not to Beat</a> to detect AF with a wearable heart rate monitor. The project is an implementation of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30106699/">recent paper on the topic</a> and uses a convolutional neural network trained on a public electrocardiogram dataset.</div>
